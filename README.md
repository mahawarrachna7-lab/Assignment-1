Diabetes Prediction Using Logistic Regression
Overview

This project aims to predict the presence of diabetes in patients using diagnostic parameters through a machine learning classification approach. The model leverages logistic regression to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic based on health indicators from the dataset diabetes2.csv.

Problem Statement ðŸŽ¯

The objective is to develop a reliable classification model that predicts the Outcome variable â€” where:

1 indicates a positive diabetes diagnosis.

0 indicates no diabetes.

The dataset contains multiple health-related features for different patients, which serve as predictors.

Abstract ðŸŽ¯

This study employs machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for diabetes diagnosis. A logistic regression classifier is trained using diagnostic metrics, then evaluated using key performance indicators such as accuracy, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix analysis. The approach focuses on providing a practical tool to assist in identifying diabetic patients effectively.

Methodology ðŸŽ¯

Data Loading:
The dataset diabetes2.csv is imported into a Pandas DataFrame. Features include:

Pregnancies

Glucose

Blood Pressure

Skin Thickness

Insulin

BMI

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Age
The target variable is Outcome.

Data Visualization:
Various plots are generated to explore the data:

Histogram of Glucose levels

Bar chart of diabetes outcome counts

Correlation heatmap of variables

Boxplot of age distribution by outcome

Data Splitting:
The dataset is split into training and testing subsets to allow model training and unbiased evaluation.

Feature Scaling:
Features are standardized using StandardScaler to normalize data and enhance model performance.

Model Training:
A logistic regression model is trained on the scaled training data to learn the relationship between features and diabetes outcomes.

Model Evaluation:
The model's predictions on the test set are evaluated using:

Accuracy

Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

Results and Output
Metric	Value
Accuracy	0.7532
Recall	0.7311
F1 Score	0.63
Confusion Matrix Breakdown
	Predicted Non-Diabetic	Predicted Diabetic
Actual Non-Diabetic	84 (True Negatives)	25 (False Positives)
Actual Diabetic	13 (False Negatives)	32 (True Positives)
Conclusion

The logistic regression model demonstrated a strong ability to predict diabetes based on the provided health metrics, achieving an accuracy of approximately 75.3%. The recall of 73.1% indicates the model successfully identifies most diabetic cases. With a balanced F1 score of 63%, the model shows good precision and recall balance. Further improvements may include exploring alternative models and feature engineering.
